        <h2><em>What To Do?</em></h2>
        If someone is choking, you should know how to use the Heimlich maneuver.
        This first aid technique should only be done if someone is truly choking.
        <h3><em>Here’s what to do next:</em></h3></B>

        1.  Stand behind the person and lean them slightly forward.<br><br>
        2. Put your arms around their waist.<br><br>
        3. Clench your fist and place it between their belly button (navel) and rib cage.<br><br> 
        4. Grab your fist with your other hand. <br><br>
        5. Pull your clenched fist sharply backward and 
        upward under the person’s rib cage in five quick thrusts.<br><br>
        6. Repeat until the object is coughed up.<br><br>
        <B>For someone who is obese or pregnant, perform the thrusts around the chest instead of the abdomen.
        <br>
        If someone is choking and becomes unconscious:<br><br></B>
        1. Place them on their back and kneel over them.<br><br>
        2. Place the heel of your hand slightly above their belly button.<br><br>
        3. Place your other hand on top of it.<br><br>
        4. Give quick upward thrusts to dislodge the object.<br><br>
        <B>
        <h><em>What to Do if You're Alone and Choking</em></h>
        You can give yourself the Heimlich maneuver even if you are alone. </B>
        <ul>
            <li>Call Emergency services first, even though you will not be able to speak. 
                Leave the phone connected. They can pinpoint your location and send emergency help.
                 Use a landline if available. If a landline isn't available, a cell phone can be used.</li><br>
            <li>Grasp one fist with the other hand and place above your belly button.</li><br>
            <li>Thrust inward and upward with your fist. Repeat until the object is dislodged.</li><br>
            <li>You can also bend over a hard surface such as the back of a chair. 
                Use the hard surface to apply repeated thrusts to your abdomen. 
                Repeat until the object is dislodged.</li>
